IoT testing cases:
- fill login credentials that are invalid
- randomly shutdown wifi AP

Possible bugs:
- Are you sure you know the HIGH/LOW logic of peripherals?
- Is code capable to work with randomly disconnecting wifi?
  - including booting it with wifi OFF?
- Have you checkted that there is no blocking code?
